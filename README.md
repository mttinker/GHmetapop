Gwaii Haanas sea otter meta-population model

MODL FILE: GHmetapop.R
EXPLANATION
 Model simulates growth of a recently colonized sea otter population at Gwaii Haanas.
 Dynamics modeled for P coastal blocks (sub-populations) linked by dispersal, with
 results of simulations then downscaled to 1km grid of coastal habitat cells. 
 Stage-structed matrix model includes density-dependence, environmental stochasticity,
 demographic stochasticity, immigration and dispersal, range expansion via diffusion,
 and habitat-based variation in local equilibrium densities.
 User provides model parameters, which are informed by analyses of data from
 sea otter populations elsewhere in BC and SE Alaska
